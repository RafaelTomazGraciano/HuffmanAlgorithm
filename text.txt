The Huffman algorithm is a well-known technique for data compression, which is used to reduce the size of data 
by encoding more frequent items with shorter codes and less frequent items with longer codes. This algorithm 
was invented by David A. Huffman in 1952 while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT. It is an example of a lossless 
compression algorithm, meaning that no data is lost in the compression process, and the original data can be 
perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.

Huffman coding is based on the idea of using variable-length codes to represent different characters. 
The key idea is to assign shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent characters. 
This results in a compressed form of the data, where the overall length of the encoded data is minimized.

Huffman codes are prefix-free, meaning that no code is a prefix of any other code. This property is essential 
because it ensures that the encoded data can be uniquely decoded. If the codes were not prefix-free, the decoder 
might encounter ambiguity when trying to decode the data.

The Huffman coding algorithm constructs a binary tree, called a Huffman tree, to generate the variable-length codes.
Each leaf node in the tree represents a character, and the path from the root to a leaf determines the code for that 
character. By traversing the tree, a unique binary code is generated for each character in the data.
